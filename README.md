# Atlas
The Atlas System Hardener is a PowerShell-based Windows 10 application that guides the user through an installation wizard-esque GUI, providing them information on system hardening practices with buttons that disable or enable certain functions to harden their system. Additionally, anything that is disabled for security will be able to be re-enabled and vice versa. Atlas focuses on an excess of accessbility to ensure all possible users can get the most of it as possible.

## Installation
To use Atlas, download the executable file and run. Keep in mind that this application was designed with only Windows 10 in mind.

## Code
To view the contents of Atlas, view the .psf file.
