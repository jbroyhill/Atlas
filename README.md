# Atlas
The Atlas System Hardener is a PowerShell-based Windows 10 application that guides the user through an installation wizard-esque GUI, providing them information on system hardening practices with buttons that disable or enable certain functions to harden their system. Additionally, anything that is disabled for security will be able to be re-enabled and vice versa, and a .json or .XML file will be printed after completing the program that allows the user to see what they've configured.
